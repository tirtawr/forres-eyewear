- Add additional images to a product by clicking on it and then adding them from the "Product Details" screen

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have more than one catalogue. What do I do? =

You can use the attribute "id='X'" in the product-catalogue shortcode to specify a catalogue, where 'X' is replaced with the catalogue ID (available at the top of the catalogue details page).

= How do I remove the sidebar from my catalogue? =

You can use the attribute "sidebar='No'" in the product-catalogue shortcode to remove the sidebar from a catalogue.

= Can I start with a layout other than the default "Thumbnail" layout? =

Add the attribute "starting_layout='LAYOUT'", where LAYOUT is replaced with the layout you would like to be the starting layout (List or Detail are the two options currently).

= How do I exclude one of the layouts? =

The attribute "excluded_layouts" lets you stop one or more layouts from being displayed. It accepts a comma separated list of layouts you wish to exclude. For example, "excluded_layouts='Thumbnail, List'" would make your catalogue display only the "Detail" view.

= What is enabled in the 'Premium' version? =

The premium version allows you to add more than 100 products to the plugin, to use the 'Tags' feature, and to add additional images to products.

= Why do I get a "Page not found" error when I turn on SEO friendly links? =

You need to have some kind of pretty permalinks already enabled on your blog for them to work on the plugin.
